# Mongo data source plugin for Grafana

Plugin is in the POC. It works but still missing a lot of features. If you have any suggestions raise them as issue on  github. 
Quick start instructions can be found [here](./doc/example/readme.md)


That's how it looks:

Most critical features currently  missing are:
 * CI-CD that ends up with artifact, that can be used
 * advance connection details
