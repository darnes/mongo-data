# Mongo data source plugin for Grafana

Plugin is in the POC. It works but still missing a lot of features. If you have any suggestions raise them as issue on  github. 

For the usage instructions [click here](./doc/usage-instructions.md)

That's how it looks:

Pre-development for smooth progress:
 - CI-CD that ends up with artifact, that can be used;
 - docs on how to use that artifact;

Most critical features currently  missing are:
 * datetime support
 * advance connection details
