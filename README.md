# Mongo data source plugin for Grafana

Plugin is in the POC. 
It works but missing a lot of features, not to  mention documentation, tests and general code  cleanup. 

If you have any suggestions raise them [here](https://github.com/darnes/mongo-data/issues).

`Quick start` instructions can be found [here](./doc/example/readme.md).


Most critical features currently missing are:
 * CI-CD that ends up with artifact, that can be used
 * advance connection details
